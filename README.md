# todo-mvc-react-hooks-experiments

Some experiments with [ReactJS Hooks ](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) based on [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/).

- master is a basic implementation using the "useState" hook
- the [`returning-state-hook`](https://github.com/fdecampredon/todo-mvc-react-hooks-experiments/tree/returning-state-hook) branch demonstrate the usage of a custom hook implementing the [returning state pattern](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/07%20-%20Returning%20State)
- the [`reactive-state`](https://github.com/fdecampredon/todo-mvc-react-hooks-experiments/tree/reactive-state) branch  demonstrate the usage of combining hooks with [Observable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
